<p><b>Most friends of mine from Delhi will demand that I take them to an Andhra restaurant that serves 'gun powder', their definition of a spicy powder. It's true that the podis (powders) are one of the best known elements of Andhra cuisine. The pale orange Kandhi Podi (Red gram powder) combines split red gram, Bengal gram and roasted gram and can be stored for months. Restaurants like National Lodge in Chennai have acquired a hallowed reputation for their Kandhi Podi. Add some of this powder to piping hot rice and a dollop of ghee, and there's probably no better way to start your Andhra meal.</b></p>

<h2 style="color:purple;"><u>2) LUKTER</u></h2><center>

<p><b>It is considered as the primary food item that is compulsorily available in the large traditional Assamese thali. The dish is non-vegetarian which is a meat delicacy; prepared from the khaar itself which is the primary ingredient mixed with raw papaya, taro, and pulses. Then all the above items are filtered with dried banana leaves for adding a kind of distinct flavour into it. This specific dish can be eaten with rice and generally included in the lunch menu</b></p>
