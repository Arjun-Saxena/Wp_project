<p><b>The most famous dish in Tamilnadu, as well as the whole southern region is Idli. Prepared with a grind mixture of soaked rice and white lentil, Idli is best to eat in the breakfast time. Best to enjoy with almost every main course, Sambar is a kind of South Indian dal (pulse). Yet, the difference is the concocting of various vegetables and spices and the sour taste.</b></p>

<h2 style="color:purple;"><u>2) JONNA</u></h2><center>

<p><b>Millets-based food dominates Telangana cuisine. Although rice is commonly consumed in this South Indian state, millets are the staple food of Telangana. This semi-arid state that sits on the Deccan plateau grows millets like jonnalu (jowar), ragulu (finger millets), sajjalu (pearl millets) abundantly, and its cuisine mostly makes use of this local produce. The tasty and healthy rotte (flatbread) made with jowar flour, finger, or pearl millet flour forms an integral part of a traditional Telangana platter</b></p>
